This repository has been deleted due to a potential security issue. If you really want to see it (and it's not much), feel free to look at the archive branch.

Some things just need to be taken off of the Internet though.
=======
This repository was based on the Ruby on Rails tutorial located at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Since the app was not being maintained and I was notified that there was a potential security vulnerability in it, I deleted the app.

In the legacy branch, the original code remains, but it's not much!
