#README

This repository was based on the Ruby on Rails tutorial located at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Since the app was not being maintained and I was notified that there was a potential security vulnerability in it, I deleted the app.

In the legacy branch, the original code remains, but it's not much!
